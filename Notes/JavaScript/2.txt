1. 6 types in javascript:
boolean, number, string, object, function, undefined

2. 5 primitive types in javascript:
boolean, number, string, null, undefined
primitive types also have corresponding class type(String)
primitive types are immutable(can't add new field)

3. Object()
with or without new keyword, (new) Object(parameter) is a function that wraps the input paramter
(primitive type)as the value, but the type is still Object. However, if the parameter is an object
it will return parameter itself directly.

so that we could take advantage of Object() to check whether an input parameter's type is Object.

function isObject(obj){
	return obj === Object(obj);
}
* better than typeof(parameter) === "Object" since function is an object but typeof(function(){})
is "function"

except boolean, number, string, undefined, null(primitive types) everything else in javascript 
is object(function and object)
