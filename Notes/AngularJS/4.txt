1. div tree structure lead inheritance

ng-repeat / ng-switch, ng-view, ng-include will generate child scope

2. scope.$apply()

== $rootScope.$digest()
// $rootScope need to be injected
app.controller("mainCtrl", ["$rootScope", "$scope", function($scope, $rootScope){}])

scope.$apply(), using this way can make child scope let parent scope know data changing.

3. $parent.value to get parent scope value


4. if value is inherited from parent, object will always inherited from parent scope even it has been changed, 
primitive type will inherit first but when the value changes it will create a new one in its own scope.

dont have: both inherit from parent
have     : both use its own value
update   : primitve type will lead generate new one since it is immutable cant change value, object value
		will still inherited from parent.
